                    <p>This year we are doing a Secret Santa gift exchange in lieu of our traditional White Elephant party. We hope that everyone will participate for fun, but of course this is a completely voluntary activity.
                    </p>
                    <p>Now for a bit of background. Secret Santa is a Christmas tradition where members of a group, whether friends, family, or co-workers, will draw random names to become someone's <em>Secret Santa</em>. The <em>Secret Santa</em> then gets
                        a thoughtful gift for their recipient and gives it to them secretly. There are variations on how gifts are chosen but we will be using the most simple set of rules.
                    </p>

                            <li>Receive your email at
                                <strong>
                                    <a href="mailto:<%= email %>">
                                        <%= email %>
                                    </a>
                                </strong>
                                with your randomly assigned recipient. [The drawing will be done randomly once signups are complete.]</li>
                        <% } %>
                            <li>Next <em>try</em> to learn something about your assigned gift recipient's likes or hobbies in order to get them a more thoughtful gift. But, you have to do so without asking them directly and without letting anyone know whom
                                your recipient is. If you can't figure out a specific gift then feel free to just get a fun present that anyone would enjoy! This is for fun after all... </li>
                            <li>Either way, once you figure out a gift then go out an get it, but remember the spending limit is <strong>$25</strong>.
                            </li>
                            <li><span style="color: red"><strong>TBD</strong></span>: deliver your gift!</li>
